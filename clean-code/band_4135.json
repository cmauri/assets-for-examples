Some of the styles he has been known to utilize are heavy prog, psychedelic, electronica, post-rock, ambient music, drone, metal, and art rock. Furthermore, WILSON is intensely focused on production values, dynamic mixing and mastering, and all other sorts of building albums that sound best in high-quality systems. In short, WILSON has always been an artist that appeals to audiophiles and fans of meticulously produced music. This shows up strongly in each of his bands and projects, but it plays even more of a role in his solo efforts.", "foundation_year": "3", "genre": "Crossover Prog - United Kingdom", "id": "4135", "name": "Steven Wilson", "picture": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmauri/assets-for-examples/main/clean-code/4135.jpg"}
