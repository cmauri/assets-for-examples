It is the pet project of multi-instrumentalist (and palaeontologist) Robert Santamaria and classically trained vocalist Lidia Cern. Their material explores new age, electronic, folk, ethnic and progressive sounds. Keyboard rhythm sequences are the basis for the calm, atmospheric melodies pictured by Cern's peaceful Spanish, ENYA-like vocals. The band does not confine their musicality to their native folk elements, however, as they combine Middle-Eastern and North African textures as well as Medieval European Minstrel orchestrations with free jazz and lots of various world music elements.", "foundation_year": "1990", "genre": "Prog Folk - Spain", "id": "1299", "name": "Amarok", "picture": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmauri/assets-for-examples/main/clean-code/1299.jpg"}
