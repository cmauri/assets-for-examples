The one constant key element was Nick Barrett. The line up then remained the same for almost 20 years, featuring : Nick Barrett (guitar/lead vocal) Clive Nolan (keys) Peter Gee (bass) and Fudge Smith (drums), until 2006 when PENDRAGON and Fudge Smith parted ways.", "foundation_year": "1978", "genre": "Neo-Prog - United Kingdom", "id": "288", "name": "Pendragon", "picture": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmauri/assets-for-examples/main/clean-code/288.jpg"}
